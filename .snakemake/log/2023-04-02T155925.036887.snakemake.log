Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bcftools_call since they might be corrupted:
calls/all.vcf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
